# Social Media Project with Ruby on Rails

In this project, we designed the ERD of the database for the different models. And then we added a self-referential functionality to the users of the forked project. We also add some database improvements on the top of friendship functionality. And finally we wrote unit and integration tests and deployed it to heroku.
